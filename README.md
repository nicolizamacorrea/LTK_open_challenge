Executive Summary: ShopFlow Returns Prediction & ROI Optimization
Approach Overview
The goal of this project was to reduce ShopFlow's $400,000 monthly return costs by predicting return-prone orders and applying targeted $3 interventions. I transitioned from a simple baseline to an advanced XGBoost model incorporating hypothesis-driven feature engineering and robust monitoring.
